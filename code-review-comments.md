What was good:
- Nice work with the 100% test coverage!
- Generally, you've followed the React design patterns. That's great! I like that you focus on the fundamentals (in React, Express, whichever library you're learning). Keep this up :-)

What could be improved:
- See inline comments in this commit
- Make this mobile responsive!
- Get more data in your initial API call. You can choose to display a limited subset if you want.
- Maybe it's a matter of personal preference, but I think choosing a sans serif font (e.g. Helvetica Neue) will make your app look more stylish
